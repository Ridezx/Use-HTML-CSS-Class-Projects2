    <h1>Zack's Lab 1</h1>

    <p>Hello, I'm Zack, I'm from North Royalton and recently graduated from both my high school and Tri-C. I transferred to the University of Cincinnati to further my education and work towards a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity. This was one of the transferable classes for Cincinnati. My knowledge of HTML and CSS is lacking, to say the least. I hope to correct that with this class.</p>
    <p>I am 18 years old and I have focused entirely on education throughout my life. I have never applied for a job, so the mandatory three internships required by Cincinnati are both exciting and scary for me. My official opinion on them will arrive after the first few weeks of an internship and will be based on how much metaphorical pain I'm in from them. I hope to be able to read and understand the 'page source' aspect of a web page at the end of this class.</p>
